          <dd><b>BEAUTY IS NOT ENOUGH</b><br>We love beautiful things, but when it comes to
design we keep it with one of Alfa Romeo’s claims:
La belezza non basta’ – Beauty is not enough!
And we get inspired by Sir Norman Foster’s motto 
‘Form follows function’. For us real beauty is not just  
a nice shell, it’s as much internal as it is external.  </dd>
